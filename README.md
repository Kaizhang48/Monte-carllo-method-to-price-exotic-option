# Monte-carllo-method-to-price-exotic-option
Three stocks, X, Y , and Z, have annual price volatilities of 20%, 25%, and 30%,
respectively. Assume they are currently trading at $100/share and that their (log) return
covariances are given by
ρ[ij] =1 if i = j
ρ[ij] =ρ otherwise.
The annual risk-free rate of return is 3% compounded continuously.

(a) A European option expires in 3 months. At that time its payoff is max(W − 110, 0)
where W is the maximum price of any of the three stocks observed between now and
expiration. Value this option for 0 ≤ ρ ≤ 1 in steps of 0.1.

(b) A different European option expiring in 3 months has payout max(A − 110, 0) where
A is the average value of the three stocks at expiration. Value this option for 0 ≤ ρ ≤ 1 in
steps of 0.1.
